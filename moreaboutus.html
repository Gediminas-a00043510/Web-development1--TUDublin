      <h1>Our Trips</h1>
      <p>
        Snow Dreams offers trips to snowy resorts for people who love skiing and snowboarding.
        We help you choose a place to go, find good slopes, and enjoy the snow with friends and family.
      </p>
      <p>
        On our trips you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn the basics if you are a beginner</li>
        <li>Explore new ski courses if you already have experience</li>
        <li>Relax all you want in our ski resorts</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Blind Snowboarders and Skiers</h1>
      <p>
        Many people do not know that blind and visually impaired people can be very good at
        snowboarding and skiing. With clear guidance and good communication, they can ride the
        same slopes as everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        On our trips we can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use simple voice directions while on the slope</li>
        <li>Describe the area and the shape of the hill</li>
        <li>Move at a pace that feels safe and comfortable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Skiing is a sport for everyone to experience. We want our trips to be a place where everyone
        can enjoy the snow together.
