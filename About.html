      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        Our website aims to provide a place for snowboarders and ski enthusiasts alike to find the way to their next
        adventure. We know how difficult it is to find a cool new spot in this niche and that's why we're here to help.

      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Founded by Lucas Snow in 2025, we are a group of passionate snow lovers who found that finding the next spot to
        conquer was the most difficult part of the hobby. We simply lacked a streamlined place to sort out our
        adventures. This is why Lucas came to us with his idea, and the rest is history.
